### Email Notifier
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
Email Notifier is a Raspberry Pi based project using SenseHAT along with the Pi that notifies when the user gets any new email. Right now it shows whenever it gets a new email irrespective of the sender and the content. But it can be customized and priorities can be assigned so that it will notify only when an important email is received. Any model of Raspberry Pi (Except Raspberry Pi 1 A/B) can be used for this project provided it has an active internet connection. The user can also integrate other services like social media notifications, which I will cover in some other post. As a notification, the RGB LEDs present over the SenseHAT is used and produces and email icon, ehich blinks if a new email is received. Again the LEDs can generate many colors and generated icon for notification can be customized depending upon the sender of the mail and priority. Instead of SenseHAT external WS2812B based modules like neopixel can also be used with a little bit of tinkering of the code or even normal RGB LEDs can be used with GPIOs. The code is written in python.
